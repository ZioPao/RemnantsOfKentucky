-- 3 Tabs

    -- Essential items tab, with basic weapons, bandages, ammo, food, and water available for sale
    -- A daily tab, where each day, 10-20 random, mostly high-value items, would be available for sale. Junk items, like staples, or corkscrews could pop up in here, but it should primarily remain something players would need for their runs.
    -- A sell tab, where players can drag items in from their inventory and sell them for cash directly into their account balance.

-- Visible balance from all three tabs (Maybe on top?), purchased items should be sent directly at the entrance of the safehouse (inside I guess)
-- The box where items will be placed has a limit of weight
